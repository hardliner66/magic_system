# This is a draft of the magic system i'm working on. Everything in here can and will probably change for the final version.

## Basics
Combining form(s) with Magicks, traits, and attributes

Ball -> Fire -> Fireball
Bolt -> Lightning -> Lightning Bolt
Bolt -> Fire -> Fire Bolt

Spells -> can change character stats

Ball -> Fire -> Water -> Steam Ball

Allow spell collision?

Should work kinda the same as combining spells

Ball -> Fire -> Fire Ball
Ball -> Water -> Water Ball

if they hit and are of the same strength, they will produce a steam ball/explosion

## Training

Wizards have certain capacity to learn spells, depending on their level.

Spells can be named and trained, which takes away from the capacity to learn.

| Combination  | Name     | Level |
|--------------|----------|:-----:|
| Ball -> Fire | Fireball |   1   |

If that capacity is reached, no more spells can be learned and you would need to unlearn spells to add new ones.

Alternative: There is no capacity, but it gets harder to master new spells as you learn more of them.

### Spell Level Stages (Draft)
0 - 10 Untrained
10 - 90 Trained
90 - 100 Mastered

## Untrained Magic
You should still be able to use magic that you haven't trained, but there should be certain disadvantages for that.
Like:
- a certain chance the spell just wont work
- undesired side effects depending on:
  - the magic that is used
  - the skill of the magic user
  - maybe: randomness

## Unlearning Spells (if there is a capacity)
The higher a spell level is, the harder it should be to unlearn.

Unlearning should take time and maybe resources.

## World Interaction

Magic should plausibly interact with the world around it.

So if something is burning, you should be able to put it out with water spells.

## Spell Tiers
Higher Tiers can only be used a certain number of times per day.

## Magic Cost
Multiple Pools of Mana. Each pool is used for a certain category of Magick.
Pools can have different means of recharging.

- Physical Mana - sleep to recharge
- Spiritual Mana - pray to recharge (evil magic can poison the soul)
- Elemental Mana - drink water, be near fire, go somewhere with wind to recharge (depending on the element)

## Magicks and forms

Magicks:
- Elemental
    - fire
    - water
    - earth
    - wind
    - darkness
    - light
- Physical
    - gravity
    - telekinesis
    - mass
- Spiritual
    - blessing
    - curse
    - illusions (nightmares or a blissful hallucination) that leaves the opponent momentarily immobilized.
- Chemical
    - manganese
    - hydrogen
    - yttrium


## etc

If you are skilled enough with a spell and have the right ingredients,
you can produce a scroll containing the spell.
